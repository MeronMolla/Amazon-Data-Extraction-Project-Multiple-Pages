# Data analytics portfolio project
This project implements Python web scraping tools to extract "data science books" information such as book titles, authors, reviews, prices, and image URL links to analyze correlation of columens and give informative insights to users. Collected data has been stored in CSV and JSON format for future use or advanced analysis.
